# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo shows projects I worked on using some common machine learning techniques. The file shown here demonstrates a ridge regularization model trained on the WHO's life expectancy data
to predict the average life span given factors such as year, developed/developing country, HIV infection rate, alcholol consumption etc.
