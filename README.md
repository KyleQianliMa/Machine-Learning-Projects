# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo shows projects I worked on using some common machine learning techniques. 

1.Linear Regression on Life Expectancy from GHO repo.ipynb is a course project on Machine Learning linear regression where three different models were created to predict the 
life expectancy in different countries by considering factors such as income, HIV infection rate, developing/developed countries etc. The three models used were normal regression, regression with polynomial features and ridge regression. Ridge regression provided best fit with a mean squared error of ~ 2 years on test data.

2.CEF_NN.ipynb is a research project that aims to use neural networks to solve a real world physics problem about electric crystal field levels. It aims to reverse engineer the process of hamiltonian calculation by training a large neural nets to do the calculation. This is an ongoing project where regularization is being developed to improve the accuracy.

3. Traffic sign recognition.ipynb is a CNN which recognize different traffice signs. Data is taken from kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign. This project involves modifying data into 30 by 30 matrices and formulating them into readable format by the neural network.
